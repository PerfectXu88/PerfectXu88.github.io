<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an undergraduate student at <a href="en.tongji.edu.cn">Tongji University</a>, , where I am actively involved in the <a href="https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/">TOPS Lab</a>. Under the guidance of <a href="https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1187.htm">Professor Jian Sun</a> and <a href="https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1383.htm">Professor Peng Hang</a>, I am pursuing research at the intersection of cutting-edge technologies in autonomous driving systems and artificial intelligence.

My research interests are primarily focused on autonomous driving, with a particular emphasis on decision-making processes, reinforcement learning techniques, and the application of foundation models. I am passionate about developing innovative solutions to improve safety, efficiency, and the overall user experience in autonomous systems.
